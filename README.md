The Attendance Management System is a simple Java program that allows users to record and manage student attendance. This README file provides an explanation of the code and how to use the system.

## Code Explanation

The main components of the code are as follows:

1. **AttendanceManagementSystem class**: This class contains methods to mark attendance and print attendance reports.

   - `markAttendance(String studentName, boolean isPresent)`: This method records the attendance status of a student (present or absent).

   - `printAttendanceReport()`: This method prints a report showing the attendance status of all students.

2. **Main method**: The `main` method provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the system.

   - Users can choose to mark attendance, print the attendance report, or exit the program.

## How to Use

1. Compile the Java code using a Java compiler.

2. Run the compiled program. The program will display a menu with the following options:
   
   - **Mark Attendance**: Enter the student's name and whether they are present or absent.

   - **Print Attendance Report**: Print a report showing the attendance status of all students.

   - **Exit**: Exit the program.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.

## Usage Tips

- The program uses a simple in-memory data structure (HashMap) to store attendance records. In a real-world scenario, consider using a database for persistent storage.

- You can customize the program further by adding features like authentication, date-based attendance, or support for multiple classes or groups.

## Notes

This program is intended as a simple example of an attendance management system. It's not meant for production use and lacks advanced features commonly found in real attendance management systems.
